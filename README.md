## Data Supremacy was an online hackathon hosted by Analytics Vidhya in which I got a global rank of 64.

In it I got to learn many new things like:
- How to handle a imbalance dataset,I have also written a post on it to help others- 
[How to handle imbalance dataset](https://medium.com/@vaibhavshukla182/how-to-handle-imbalanced-datasets-d67176dfb0aa)

- I have used satcked regression for prediction which gave me an added advantage

- For filling missing values instead of just filling them with their mean or median type values, I have predicted them using Machine Learning.
